# Research-scripts
General purpose research scripts for a numerical questionaaire DB
The scripts are used to create streamlit apps where you can upload data bases where the index has 2 levels - the first is user ID and the second a date when the row's data was collected. Each column's title is a research question and the data itself is each user's answers to the questions in numerical form.
